# Communicate Data Findings
The final project achieved in Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).
# Purpose
The objective of this project is to study a specific dataset and communicate the findings through a slide deck presentation containin visualized work and key observations.
# Dataset and motivation
I used [prosper.com's](http://www.prosper.com/) gathered data about loan borrowers. Prosper is an investment company located in California, USA. I am interested to present the interest rates reactions with a different set of variables and what main purposes are behind loan listings, how is this looking with interest rates.
# Key takeouts
Some advanced studies can be done on this analysis if we bring in more variables from the source data. However, I have no Financial background and my study is based on my observations on the various behaviours I get.

One point I do not affirm my understanding about is the Debt to income ratio in the multivariate analysis I did on the Debt Consolidation listing, I cannot confirm or dismiss that a debt to income ratio as high as 10 is actual (you have 10 times a debt than your income!).
